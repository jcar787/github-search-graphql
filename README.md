# # Github Search using GraphQL

Clone the repository and run `npm install`
To run the tests run `npm test`
Create a .env with the following variables:
`REACT_APP_GITHUB_URL` - Check the docs for the github grapql url. Is only one endpoint ðŸ™‚

`REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Request an access token from github

`REACT_APP_DEBUG` - This one is optional. If you want to see how the state changes in redux just add a 1, otherwise just don't add it

After you set up the environment variables, run `npm start` and then start making searches.

Open an issue if you found any bugs in it.
